# vue-todo
A basic application created using Vue. The Application features a container ( a text box) and a ADD button. We can provide some content in the text-box, and then click the add button which will insert the content of the text box in an unordered list. Every item in the list will have a "x" icon, which will enable us to delete the selected item. There is also a validation rule applied, to validate that the contents of the text box should be atleast 5 characters.
